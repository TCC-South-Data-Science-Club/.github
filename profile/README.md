### WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
The [Windows Subsytem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) is a feature on Windows computers that allows you to run a Linux environment on your computer without the need to install a virtual machine / brand new operating system on your system. This may seem pointless right now, but as you progress in your career as a developer, becoming familiar with using Linux is crucial as most server-side applications will be written for and deployed on Linux servers. The Linux environment also comes preinstalled with a host of tools that you will find very useful during your journey as a developer. As such, this step is crucial and is a requirement moving forward.

To install WSL on your machine, I highly recommend following [this](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) guide. When choosing a distro from the Microsoft store, select the latest LTS release of Ubuntu (24.04 at the time of writing this). Although this guide was written for Windows 10, these same steps will also work on Windows 11.

Once you have WSL installed on your machine, there are a few very big disclaimers that need to be addressed before you continue on with this guide.
1. It is crucial that you understand the difference between installing applications on Windows 10 vs. on Linux Bash.
2. NEVER Modify any Linux files from a Windows 10 application (For example, from VS Code).
3. DO NOT SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT SHELL. You should only be using Bash. Do not try to change this to something like zsh or fish.

If you do not know what the 3rd point means, don't worry about it as it is very unlikely you will do this by mistake. All three of these points will be expaned upon under the Linux guide, here: [Linux and Your Machine](https://github.com/TCC-South-Data-Science-Club/lessons/blob/main/environment/linux-and-your-machine.md)

Speaking of the Linux guide, if you are unfamiliar with the Linux Kernel, I stress that you please look over the guide. At the very least, make sure that you are comfortable with using the command line and know the basic commands.
